## Design decisions

* Good to show value when disabled
* No need to make radio buttons have a red outline when there's an error
* Value is boolean (true | false | null)
* Once set, there's no way to unset
* There's what feels like more padding above the question when used with a FormGroup.
  This is a result of the default height of the radio inputs (circles).
  The control is as tall as others like input fields.  This ensures a good clickable area so I've left alone.
