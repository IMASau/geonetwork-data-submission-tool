# Unresolved

* Review error highlighting.  Should label highlight?
* Inline flag is default behaviour at the moment.  Doesn't align perfectly with mockups:
  * Helper text appears under controls rather than under label as show in some dialog mockups.
  * Inline labels seems not to guarantee width for neat column of labels.
