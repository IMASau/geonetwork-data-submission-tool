Copy_of_Metadata_Template_with_Comments.xml

It should be the same as the metadata template except that it contains comments.

Metadata_Template - backup.xml
This file was created to allow comparison of the current metadata master template 
deployed prior to 20/05/2020 with the work in progress for branch jira_486
to create as-is and to-be documentation

Template_for_Service_reviewed_2.1.xml
As at 20/5/2020
SG doesn't want to do separate Service Metadata Records
But the template was work in progress so has been added to bitbucket in case we want to revisit in future.
Also note that ICSM Meta Data Working Group are currently reviewing requirements
for best practice with respect to Service Metadata.
For the status of this record, see:
esupport@tern.org.au TERNDESK-929 FW: schema errors for 19115-3 XML in Oxygen
and https://ternaus.atlassian.net/browse/TERNDA-286

with some additional comments at the top.
