## Intent

Unclear how this might specifically be used.

* The following fields are required - A list of labels for required fields which need to be completed
* The following fields need attention - A list of labels for fields which have errors
* A list of specific error messages and which fields they apply to

I guess the common case is "required fields" but I expect we will see some values which are invalid
and have errors associated with them.

Needs input.
